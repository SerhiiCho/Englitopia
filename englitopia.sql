(2, 'Perfectionism', 'Perfectionism, in psychology, is a personality trait characterized by a person\'s striving for flawlessness and setting high performance standards, accompanied by critical self-evaluations and', '<p>Perfectionism, in psychology, is a personality trait characterized by a person\'s striving for flawlessness and setting high performance standards, accompanied by critical self-evaluations and concerns regarding others\' evaluations.It is best conceptualized as a multidimensional characteristic, as psychologists agree that there are many positive and negative aspects. In its maladaptive form, perfectionism drives people to attempt to achieve an unattainable ideal while their adaptive perfectionism can sometimes motivate them to reach their goals. In the end, they derive pleasure from doing so. When perfectionists do not reach their goals, they often fall into depression.</p>\n\n<p>Perfectionists strain compulsively and unceasingly toward unobtainable goals, and measure their self-worth by productivity and accomplishment.[4] Pressuring oneself to achieve unrealistic goals inevitably sets the person up for disappointment. Perfectionists tend to be harsh critics of themselves when they fail to meet their standards.</p>\n\n<h3>Normal vs. neurotic</h3>\n\n<p>D. E. Hamachek in 1978 argued for two contrasting types of perfectionism, classifying people as tending towards normal perfectionism or neurotic perfectionism. Normal perfectionists are more inclined to pursue perfection without compromising their self-esteem, and derive pleasure from their efforts. Neurotic perfectionists are prone to strive for unrealistic goals and feel dissatisfied when they cannot reach them. Hamachek offers several strategies that have proven useful in helping people change from maladaptive towards healthier behavior.Contemporary research supports the idea that these two basic aspects of perfectionistic behavior, as well as other dimensions such as \"nonperfectionism\", can be differentiated. They have been labeled differently, and are sometimes referred to as positive striving and maladaptive evaluation concerns, active and passive perfectionism, positive and negative perfectionism, and adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism. Although there is a general perfectionism that affects all realms of life, some researchers contend that levels of perfectionism are significantly different across different domains (i.e. work, academic, sport, interpersonal relationships, home life).\n\nOthers such as T. S. Greenspon disagree with the terminology of \"normal\" vs. \"neurotic\" perfectionism, and hold that perfectionists desire perfection and fear imperfection and feel that other people will like them only if they are perfect. For Greenspon, perfectionism itself is thus never seen as healthy or adaptive, and the terms \"normal\" or \"healthy\" perfectionism are misnomers, since absolute perfection is impossible. He argues that perfectionism should be distinguished from \"striving for excellence\", in particular with regard to the meaning given to mistakes. Those who strive for excellence can take mistakes (imperfections) as incentive to work harder. Unhealthy perfectionists consider their mistakes a sign of personal defects. For these people, anxiety about potential failure is the reason perfectionism is felt as a burden.</p>\n\n<h3>Multidimensional perfectionism scale</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"img/content/Perfectionism.jpg\">Randy O. Frost et al. (1990) developed a multidimensional perfectionism scale (now known as the \"Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale\", FMPS) with six dimensions: concern over making mistakes, high personal standards (striving for excellence), the perception of high parental expectations, the perception of high parental criticism, the doubting of the quality of one\'s actions, and a preference for order and organization.</p>\n\n<p>Hewitt & Flett (1991) devised another \"multidimensional perfectionism scale\", a 45-item measure that rates three aspects of perfectionistic self-presentation: self-oriented perfectionism, other-oriented perfectionism, and socially prescribed perfectionism. Self-oriented perfectionism is having unrealistic expectations and standards for oneself that lead to perfectionistic motivation. An example is the constant desire to achieve an ideal physical appearance out of vanity. Other-oriented perfectionism is having unrealistic expectations and standards for others that in turn pressure them to have perfectionistic motivations of their own. Socially prescribed perfectionism is developing perfectionistic motivations due to the fact that significant others expect them to be perfect. Parents that push their children to be successful in certain endeavors (such as athletics or academics) provide an example of this type of perfectionism, as the children feel that they must meet their parents\' lofty expectations.</p>\n\n<p<A similarity has been pointed out among Frost\'s distinction between setting high standards for oneself and the level of concern over making mistakes in performance (the two most important dimensions of the FMPS and Hewitt & Flett\'s distinction between self-oriented versus socially prescribed perfectionism.</p>\n\n<h3>Almost perfect scale-revised</h3>\n\n<p>Slaney and his colleagues (1996) developed the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R) to identify perfectionists (adaptive or maladaptive) and non-perfectionists. People are classified based on their scores for High Standards, Order, and Discrepancy measures. Both adaptive and maladaptive perfectionists rate highly in High Standards and Order, but maladaptive perfectionists also rate highly in Discrepancy. Discrepancy refers to the belief that personal high standards are not being met, which is the defining negative aspect of perfectionism. Maladaptive perfectionists typically yield the highest social stress and anxiety scores, reflecting their feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. In general, the APS-R is a relatively easy instrument to administer, and can be used to identify perfectionist adolescents as well as adults, though it has yet to be proven useful for children.[6] Interestingly, in one study evaluating APS-R in an adolescent population, maladaptive perfectionists obtained higher satisfaction scores than non-perfectionists. This finding suggests that adolescents\' high standards may protect them from challenges to personal satisfaction when their standards are not met.Two other forms of the APS-R measure perfectionism directed towards intimate partners (Dyadic Almost Perfect Scale) and perceived perfectionism from one\'s family (Family Almost Perfect Scale).</p>', 'introduction, conversation, test, cat', 21, '2017-10-10 08:21:52', 'Some Dude', '', 2, '');
